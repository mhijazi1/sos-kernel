SOS: the Stupid Operating System
--------------------------------

SOS is a simple, tiny toy OS implemented in Rust.

I'm writing this mostly for fun, to learn more about OS design and kernel hacking, so don't expect anything new or exciting out of this project.

Inspiration, and a reasonable amount of code, taken from @phil-opp's great [series of blog posts](http://os.phil-opp.com) on the subject, Charlie Somerville's [rustboot](https://github.com/charliesome/rustboot), and Samy Pess√©'s [_How to Make an Operating System_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/samypesse/how-to-create-an-operating-system/details).

The Makefile currently expects that you're using cross-compiled GNU `binutils`, since I'm building on my Mac and the OS X linker obviously won't work. Eventually it'll be smarter about this.

### Design goals

 + **POSIX compliance is not a goal** (though it would be cool)
 + **Hybrid/loosely microkernel** (i.e., move code to user space *when convenient/practical*)
 + Possibly provide the Rust stdlib at the OS level.
 + JVM-style memory allocation?
 + Possibly experiment with a [Plan 9-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P_(protocol)) networking stack eventually?


### Building & Running

This project includes Git submodules; you will want to clone it using `git clone --recursive` or run `git submodule update --init` after cloning.

#### You will need:

+ Rust; I strongly recommend installing it using [multirust](https://github.com/brson/multirust)
+ `nasm`
+ `grub-mkrescue` and possibly `xorriso` depending on whether your system considers it to be part of the `mkrescue` package (ugh)
+ `qemu`, specifically `qemu-system-x86_64`; unless you want to try SOS on bare metal (which I cannot possibly endorse)

+ **Setting up**
    + You only need to run these steps once
    + `$ multirust default nightly-2015-11-08` this version of Rust is known to work with our patched version of `libcore`
    + `$ make runtime` compiles the patched `libcore`
+ **Running the OS**
    + `$ make run` compiles the kernel, makes the ISO, and boots QEMU from the ISO

#### Using Vagrant

To avoid tooling and dependency hell (especially on Macs), I'm using a Vagrant config written by @ashleygwilliams (see her repo [here](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/x86-kernel)).

To run using vagrant (from the repo root directory):

 + `$ vagrant up`
 + `$ vagrant ssh -- -Y`
 + `$ cd /vagrant`
 + Follow the instructions from above
